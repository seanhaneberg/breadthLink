# breadthLink

This is a solution to an interview question that caused me grief several years ago.

Given a traditional binary tree (not necessarily sorted by any particular rules), link each node to its next neighbor to the right.

This proves out the algorithm, but the code is pretty rough. Feels like a derpy mix of C++, STL, and C. :-)
